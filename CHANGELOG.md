  - You can check whether your model supports this connection method in the Homebridge plugin settings UI on the 'My Devices' tab
  - The different connection methods work with each other so it is possible to enable both AWS and bluetooth control for your lights
- **Scenes/Music/DIY Modes**
  - If you Govee Lights support AWS or bluetooth connection, you can use the plugin settings and the Eve app to setup HomeKit scenes for your Govee scenes, music mode and DIY modes that you have created in the Govee app. Check the wiki for more information.

- Plugin will automatically retry HTTP connection on startup in the event of certain error codes
- **In Development**
  - A configuration option to expose four non-working scenes per light device
  - The idea of this is to experiment with how scenes could work if Govee enable this functionality through the API
  - The scene buttons that appear have **no** effect except logging what should happen

### Changed

- Less strict threshold for determining a 'significant' colour change for disabling Adaptive Lighting
- Show a more user friendly log message on timeout error from Govee

- Suitable range for `adaptiveLightingShift` added to description
- Link to 'Uninstall' wiki page in the plugin-ui
- Updated minimum Homebridge to v1.1.7

- Configuration setting `controlInterval` to change the 7500ms delay introduced in v2.9.0
  - This setting is visible in the Homebridge plugin UI screen under 'Optional Settings'
  - The default value for this setting will be 500ms but if you experience connectivity issues I would suggest increasing this number (by multiples of 500) until you find a value which works well for you

### Changed

- Error stack will be hidden when the disabled plugin message appears in the log
- More colour conversation formula changes

### Fixed

- Brightness fix for the H6003

## v2.9.0 (2021-02-06)

### Added

- This release hopes to bring more reliability when using HomeKit scenes and device groupings, by using:
  - A queueing system for device updates (HTTP requests) to replace the random delays
  - Delays between HTTP requests are set to 7.5 seconds which seems to work reliably
  - The refresh interval for device sync will skip whilst device updates are being sent
- Configuration checks to highlight any unnecessary or incorrectly formatted settings you have
- Link to 'Configuration' wiki page in the plugin-ui

### Changed

- ⚠️ `ignoredDevices` configuration option is now an array not a string
- If a device's current status cannot be retrieved then the log message will only be displayed in debug mode

## v2.8.0 (2021-01-18)

### Changed

- Plugin will log incoming device updates in `debug` mode
  - For standard usage I would recommend to have plugin `debug` mode set to OFF/FALSE, as this change will add an update to your log every X seconds depending on your refresh interval (which is 15 seconds by default)

### Fixed

- Brightness fix for `H7022` model

## v2.7.3 (2021-01-14)
