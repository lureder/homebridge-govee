/**
 * What a device can do, worked out from several sources rather than one table.
 *
 * Writing out all six hundred models by hand is a job nobody finishes, and it
 * throws away the two things we already have: Govee's own API says what each
 * device can do, and some behaviour depends on firmware rather than model. So
 * instead of a table this asks a series of layers and takes the first answer:
 *
 *   1. user config      an explicit setting always wins
 *   2. firmware         this model, at or above this firmware version
 *   3. model            written down because someone worked it out
 *   4. discovered       what this particular device reported it can do
 *   5. family           what this kind of appliance usually has
 *
 * Most models never need an entry of their own. They are answered by what the
 * device reported plus the family defaults, which is why this scales to models
 * nobody has written down.
 *
 * ⚠️ Family defaults are deliberately generous. A control this plugin has
 * offered for years may be in use by someone, and taking it away to tidy up
 * would break a working setup. Only a model entry - written after someone
 * confirmed it - is allowed to say a device does not have something.
