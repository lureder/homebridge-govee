/**
 * This handler exists for sensors whose readings have not been worked out. It
 * offers no tiles and instead prints what the device sends, so one owner's log
 * is enough to build the real thing.
 *
 * That only works if the payload is actually in the line. It read a `scene`
 * field that nothing anywhere sets, so every report went out carrying just the
 * model and the word "scene" - no frame, nothing to decode. These pin that a
 * report contains something an owner could act on.
